First, define a variable called n, and let the user inputs the value of n.
Next, use a while loop. The loop will stop if n is equal to 1.
In the while loop, first, use an if else statement to determine what way n should be changed.
Second, print out the value of n.
The program will display the value of n until it is equal to one.
