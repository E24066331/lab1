First, define a variable called n, and let the user input the value of n.
Next, use a while loop to make the if else statements keep running until n is equal to 1.
In the while loop, first, print out the value of n.
Second, use an if else statement to determine what way n should be changed.
The program will display the value of n until it is equal to one.
